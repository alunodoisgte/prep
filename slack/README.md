# [⏪ Join the Slack Chat Room](/README.md)

> 💬 **The chat room is the most important thing for you to learn and
rememeber from this Prep course.** Everything else depends on it.

Each school or group has their own Slack Chat room. This tool helps
you with many important things:

1. You find your workbook invites in your course channel (ex: `#prep`)
1. You can ask questions about anything
1. You can make and stay connected with friends
1. You can coordinate your work on projects with your team
1. You can post your projects and work for others to review
1. You can read about news, alerts, and events `#news`

**You should check the chat at least once a week** to stay informed
about what is going on. If you forget how to get to it, go to the
home page ([skilstak.io](http://skilstak.io)) and find your location.
The chat room is linked from there. If you have questions about
anything else, where something is, how to do it, if we are open,
*everything* is in there. **Each chat room is private for your
location and you can direct message anyone at the location including
students and staff.**

Slack is the leading chat tool used by businesses, schools,
open source development teams, organizations, and about everything
else. It comes with a great mobile app that makes communication in
chat as easy as text messages. This is no *made-for-education* chat
tool, it's a *real* tool used by professionals, which is the main
reason we require learning it.

Because we use a private repo (for obvious reasons) you'll need an
invite from your instructor, teacher assistant, or location manager.
Here's what it looks like in your in box:
