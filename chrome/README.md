## [⏫ Why Google Chrome?](#)

> Concepts: Browser Adoption, Browser Security, Browser Quality

Google Chrome is the only browser we use.  It is indisputably the
most advanced and popular in the world.

Not only does Google Chrome comply with the existing standards but
often implements them well before the standard has been adopted by any
other browser. Frequently Chrome is the first to implement it.

## [⏫ ⏪ Use Chrome Incognito](#)

Whenever you use a web browser on a system you do not trust, even here
since the student sitting in your chair after you might not even know
to logout and might delete all your bookmarks or email, (which has
unfortunately happened more than once here).

**Incognito (in-cog-NEE-to) is a way to use Chrome so that the
person before you or after you is not affected by what you do.**
The creators of CodeCombat.com recommended that we use Incognito
mode to avoid having one student do levels for the one before. We
have found this works for a lot of things—especially those that
that use Google+ or GitHub for logins. This protects against the
risk of other students deleting your work, bookmarks, or worse. So
here's how to do it.

Outside of SkilStak™ it is always a good idea to use Incognito mode on
*any* publicly used computer including those at schools, campuses,
and libraries. One way thieves get your passwords is to setup
listeners on the web browser and wait for unsuspecting people to enter
their information while browsing.
