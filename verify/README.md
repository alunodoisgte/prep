# [⏪ Get Verified](/README.md)

**Congratulations you made it!** The last step is to sit down with
your location manager, who is also the head instructor, and verify
everything in your workbook. Usually this will happen soon after
your IDP conversation. The purpose is to ensure that you feel ready
and actually are ready to move on. It is not a test so much as it
is a milestone, a checkpoint on your journey to become a great
developer.

The reason for this process is to ensure that you will feel comfortable
and challenged and that other students will know that you have done
the work necessary to keep up in class.  Everyone is always at a
slightly different level, but this minimizes any big gaps in your
skills.
