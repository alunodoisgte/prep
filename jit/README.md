# [⏪ Learn to Learn, Just in Time](/README.md)

Anyone who has spent any amount of time in IT knows the most important
skill to learn is how to learn, often just in time to make the
deadline. When combined with a solid foundation in logical thinking
and creative problem solving just-in-time learning allows those in
IT to quickly digest any relevant technology, understand it, and
apply it productively.

> Just do it. Don't let your dreams be dreams. Learn to learn.  

How do you identify people who have not learned this important
skill?  By the number of times they ask stupid questions they could
have researched themselves in seconds. You know the type. The ones
to lazy to *read the freaking manual* themselves and have no problem
wasting your time to fix their problems. ["Here let me Google that
for you,"](http://lmgtfy.com) is the usual response to this unfortunate
type of individual.  Don't be one of these.  Don't hate 'em, just
don't be one.
