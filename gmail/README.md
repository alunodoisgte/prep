Having a Google account is an absolute essential today and **required
for being a SkilStak™ student**. Most web services and games have an
option to login with Google. There is also no email service that
beats Gmail in its ability to filter out spam, manage your inbox,
and create multiple accounts.  

## [⏫ Under 13](#)

If you are under 13 you will already have an email setup that belongs
to your SkilStak™ location manager. You won’t have access to the
emails sent to it, but can use it for any educational tool that needs
an email provided. The format of the email is
`skilstak.<location>+<yourid>.<suf>@gmail.com`. Here are some email
address examples as used by different services:

* GitHub: `skilstak.cornelius+you@gmail.com`
* Slack: `skilstak.cornelius+you@gmail.com`
* CodeCombat (Python): `skilstak.cornelius+you.py@gmail.com`
* CodeCombat (Web): `skilstak.cornelius+you.js@gmail.com`

> ⛔ Do NOT continue if you are under 13. The rest of this page is for
> those 13 or over **only** who wish to create their own Gmail
> account.
>
> 💬 Even if your parents have setup an email for you we will still use
> your SkilStak™ email until you are 13 to ensure password recovery
> and such can be done quickly without needing your parents to
> intervene. For parents who request it we can setup an auto-forward
> of a copy of every email received by the student to an email they
> provide.

## [⏫ 13 and Up](#)

> ⛔ If you are under 13 *STOP NOW!*

> 💬 Unlike other schools, after you turn 13 we can setup a permanent
> forward to whatever email you have setup for yourself. If you have
> just turned 13 contact your *location manager* to help setup
> forwarding. Keep in mind that your location manager will have access
> to all, but only, emails send through your SkilStak™ address so you
> will want to tell everyone to use your new address only.

## [⏫ Your Most Important Password](#)

Gmail is the most important account and password information that you
remember. This is because you can forget the passwords and login
information to everything else and recover it rather simply by
providing your Gmail information that you used to create those
accounts.

When creating an account ***make sure you setup some sort of password
recovery option, preferrably a phone number.***

## [⏫ Multiple Gmail Accounts](#)

One of the main reasons Gmail makes the most sense is its support of
*multiple gmail account names*.

A lot of people don't know that when you create a Gmail account you
are actually creating an infinite number of different email addresses
that you can use for everything and anything, but that all direct
email sent to any of them to the same, single account. For example,
all of the following will go to the same `youraccount@gmail.com`
account:

* `youraccount@gmail.com`
* `your.account@gmail.com`
* `y.o.u.r.a.c.c.o.u.n.t@gmail.com`
* `youraccount+py@gmail.com`
* `youraccount+js@gmail.com`
* `youraccount+whatever@gmail.com`

This is extremely useful when you need more than one account on
another service, like CodeCombat, Twitter, GitHub or whatever else.
