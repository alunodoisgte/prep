Although people call it that, it is so much more. We have had
students approached for jobs based on what was in their GitHub repo.
Those seeking qualified candidates—particularly with hard to find
skills—regularly search GitHub for repos containing what they are
after. Colleges and other schools use GitHub as a portfolio of sorts
when examining the work and community activity of a potential
candidate. Some would go so far as to say that if you do *not* have
a GitHub profile demonstrating your work and activity that you are
simple are irrelevant. Are there successful, amazing, brilliant
engineers who are *not* on GitHub? Of course, but the ones that are
getting the visibility and the jobs of their choice are.

> 💬 One of the saddest realities about the tech work force in big
> companies in particular is that they become walled off from
> innovation and new discoveries happening outside their own
> enterprise. Many careers have died when such individuals suddenly
> find themselves looking for a job with a tool box full of old,
> rusted, dull tools. **Keep your tools sharp at all times, no matter
> where you are working.** Imagine if a doctor, or even an orthodontist
> did not keep up on new technologies and techniques. Yet somehow
> technologists get lulled into thinking they are not required to hold
> themselves to the same standard of up-to-date-ness.
