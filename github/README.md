## [⏫ “Facebook for Developers”](#)

Although people call it that, it is so much more. We have had
students approached for jobs based on what was in their GitHub repo.
Those seeking qualified candidates—particularly with hard to find
skills—regularly search GitHub for repos containing what they are
after. Colleges and other schools use GitHub as a portfolio of sorts
when examining the work and community activity of a potential
candidate. Are there successful, amazing, brilliant
engineers who are *not* on GitHub? Of course, but the ones that are
getting the visibility and the jobs of their choice are.

> 💬 One of the saddest realities about the tech work force in big
> companies in particular is that they become walled off from
> innovation and new discoveries happening outside their own
> enterprise. Many careers have died when such individuals suddenly
> find themselves looking for a job with a tool box full of old,
> rusted, dull tools. **Keep your tools sharp at all times, no matter
> where you are working.** Imagine if a doctor, or even an orthodontist
> did not keep up on new technologies and techniques. Yet somehow
> technologists get lulled into thinking they are not required to hold
> themselves to the same standard of up-to-date-ness.

## [⏫ Sign Up](#)

Make sure you are in [Incognito][] if you are on a public Chrome
web browser. Go to [github.com](http://github.com) in your web
browser.

[Incognito]: /chrome/README.md#user-content--use-chrome-incognito

## [⏫ Pick a Lowercase Screen Name](#)

> 🍎 Students who are under 13 likely have had this done already.

You want a lowercase GitHub name especially since it becomes a part of
your web site address and every single Git URL you have to type to
check out all your GitHub repos full of code later.

## [⏫ Select the Free Plan](#)

No need for anything more—especially since as a student you get
unlimited private repos when you apply for them.

![](/assets/github2.png)

## [⏫ Skip the Survey](#)

![](/assets/github3.png)

## [⏫ Start a Project](#)

We will go ahead and create a first project to have something to work
with a little later. We will create a special project that will
contain your personal web site hosted for free by GitHub.

![](/assets/github4.png)

## [⏫ Verify you Email Address](#)

![](/assets/github5.png)

## [⏫ Find the Email](#)

And click on “verify email address”.

![](/assets/github6.png)

## [⏫ Create a New Repository](#)

We will name this a special name that GitHub uses to identify your
personal web site. The name must be your exact account name, followed
by `.github.io`.

![](/assets/github7.png)

## [⏫ Create a README](#)

In case you have not noticed yet, this entire course textbook is
hosted on GitHub with `README.md` files. These are very convenient and
powerful. Make one now.

![](/assets/github8.png)

## [⏫ Change the Name and Edit](#)

Rather than name this one `README.md`, which is good for most repos,
we will name it `index.html` instead. This special file name is
universally known to be the default web page to show on a web site.

![](/assets/github9.png)

## [⏫ Commit New File](#)

Do not forget to `Commit` your work. This is the equivalent of save.

![](/assets/github10.png)

## [⏫ Change Your Profile Icon](#)

Yeah, un-noob yourself by taking a moment to find an icon you like.
Keep in mind this icon will also be the icon that SkilStak™ uses for
you in our achievements profile system. 

> 🍎 Teachers and parents should be aware of the image selected by the
> student—especially for those under 13.

## [⏫ The Rest of Your Profile](#)

> 🍎 This will be left blank for obvious reasons for those under 13.
