# [⏪ Agree to Policies](/README.md)

Blah, blah. Yeah, I know. Policies are lame. But it is kinda important
that you—and more importantly—your parents understand them. 

## [⏫ Payment](#)

All payment is due in advance by the posted deadline, no exceptions.
All payments are through PayPal. Deadlines are listed on your
location's web site and calendar. *Senior Students* can earn
up to full tuition in rebates working on staff as teacher assistants
and such if they qualify and are selected.

## [⏫ Strikes](#)

Students automatically agree to the [student pledge](/pledge/README.md)
when they register. Violations of the pledge, as judged by the
instructor and/or the location manager, will be counted as strikes.
Three strikes and students are immediately removed from SkilStak
with no refund.  A strike can be cleared after one year without any
additional strikes.

Strikes for the school are more severe and are different than
[strikes for Pro](http://pro.skilstak.io).

## [⏫ Destruction of Property](#)

Any destruction of any SkilStak™ property on site or at any hosting
facility will result in immediate dismissal and possible prosecution.

## [⏫ Violation of Privacy, Information Theft](#)

Accessing or attempting to access any information from any other
student or staff member—that they have not already released to open source or public domain—without their consent including code, art,
passwords, or other personal information will result in immediate
dismissal from the school and a strong possibility of prosecution.

> 💬 Be very careful here, what you think might be a funny prank against
> one or more of your friends might wind up getting you kicked out
> of SkilStak™ and prosecuted. That would be a horrible start to your
> career. Also be careful not to even put any such code on GitHub
> or any system for which SkilStak™ pays hosting fees because this
> not only jeopardizes your career, it brings legal scrutiny on the school
> and everyone who works and attends.

Also, be aware that anything you put into GitHub is considered open
and most assume they can use it without problem. If you do *not*
want your GitHub repo source code used by another make sure to
create a license saying so in that repo. Most here are fine, however,
because all our course work is now private in GitHub Classroom
workbook repos.

## [⏫ No Refunds](#)

No refunds will be given. Decisions about whether to have a given
course are based on registration numbers not changing. **When in
doubt apply for less or don't apply at all.** Our students deserve
to have other students as committed as them who will seek opportunities
to work on stuff even outside of class and who would rarely miss a
week and, even then, only for extreme exceptions.

In exceptional cases—with written approval from the location
manager—tuition paid that would otherwise be lost can be used **up
to a year** from that date for other programs for which the student
may still be eligible or given to another family member or student
currently still enrolled in the school or to a new applicant.

## [⏫ Referral Bonus](#)

If a new student gives the email address or exact name of a current
student or parent who has referred them ***before*** the new person
pays for their registration the person named will receive 5% off
their next semester enrollment. The new person does not receive any
discount.

## [⏫ First Paid, First Registered](#)

All courses require full payment to reserve a place in that course.
Courses do and will fill far before the registration/payment deadline.
Watch the calendar to keep track of how courses are filling.

## [⏫ Changing Classes](#)

Students can always switch class times if there is room. This allows
students to find a class with the group and feel that works best for
them.

## [⏫ Four Students Minimum Required to Hold Course](#)

Courses with less than four enrolled at the beginning of the
semester will be canceled and the money returned if another suitable
class is not available. This is the only case where refunds are
offered.

## [⏫ Learning to Code Demands Regular Attendance](#)

We didn't make this rule, the coding gods did. Learning computer
programming requires regular, consistent contact with it. Moreover
the pace of instruction at our nano-school requires high-level of
commitment from every student. We demand it from our students and
they each demand it from each other. Unlike other schools, missing
even one class is very disruptive for everyone if it is not properly
made up.

## [⏫ Makeups](#)

We understand students will have to miss occasionally for sickness,
weather, or other conflicts. We offer up to, (but not more than),
two makeups up to two weeks from the time of the first missed class.
In other words, **all makeup opportunities expire two weeks from
the date of the missed class**. Students can either attend the same
course at a different time in addition to their regular course or
can arrange to make up material during the time of a different
course.

**All makeups require 48 hour advanced notice by email to [your
location's email
address](/communications.md#enrollment-and-makeups-use-email) to
attend** in order to arrange for the proper number of teacher
assistants and such. **Makeups are never as good as classes because
multiple courses are represented in the lab.** When in doubt call
or ask first.

## [⏫ Loss of Eligibility](#)

As unpleasant as it is to discuss it is important students and
parents understand that **we reserve the right to deny any
application or withdraw enrollment eligibility from any student for
any reason at any time with no refund**. This is very rare and every
effort is made to ensure such students are not accepted into the
school in the first place.

Students who become abusive, physical, harassing, disrespectful,
or distract others from learning in any way, who regularly lose
focus, who fail to complete projects, or who require more than one
assistant per three students to meet their attention needs will not
be eligible for continued enrollment. In severe cases parents will
be called to immediately remove the former student from the school.

We have the somewhat unique privilege to ensure only those
that are willing to learn and help are in the school. For the good
of those students contributing and learning we will not hesitate
to take immediate action when needed to maintain the best possible
learning environment.

## [⏫ Parent Visits](#)

We welcome and encourage visits from parents to monitor any class
in which their student is enrolled. However, due the size or our
classrooms, and in order to not overbook too many monitoring parents
at a time, we require at least one week (7-days) advanced notice by
email.

## [⏫ Understand Communications](#)

Parents and student are responsible to ensure they understand
and use the [communications methods described
separately](communications.md).

## [⏫ Staff Rebates](#)

**SkilStak™ works because of its students, literally.** Exceptional
students fulfill the needs of other students as the serve as
teacher assistants, student instructors, system administrators, and
developers.

Students can earn up to the cost of their entire tuition in rebates
for working on SkilStak™ staff. However, since most students are under
the age they cannot legally be paid as contractors or employees.
Therefore, the maximum any student can work for SkilStak™ and be paid
is the cost of their tuition. Students can enroll for more offerings
if they wish to work more.

## [⏫ PayPal](#)

**All transactions are through PayPal™**, payment, rebates, everything.
Legally a student must be over 18 to use a PayPal account individually
without being tied to a parent. When staff rebates and/or payments
are made the student and parent provide the email to receive the
funds via PayPal. SkilStak™ is not responsible for anything beyond
that transfer of funds including security breaches of the student
or parent’s account or lost or forgotten passwords.

As with any financial transactions **the security of the student
or parent’s PayPal account is the responsibility of the student or
parent not SkilStak™**. Care should be taken to security that account
including two-factor authentication, strong passwords, and frequent
account reviews. SkilStak™ is not responsible for any loss of funds
for any reason for any staff member account once the receipt of the
money has been acknowledged.
