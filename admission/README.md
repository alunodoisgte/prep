# [⏪ Admission](/README.md)

We welcome everyone to SkilStak™ from all backgrounds and abilities.
In fact often those that think coding might not be for them end up
the best coders of all. 

However, in order to ensure the best experience for everyone we
need to make sure only motivated, capable students are admitted in
the first place. This is not the same as a “good” or “bad” student,
just the distinction between those who meet the following and those
that don’t:

1. Want to learn
2. Able to use the basic tools we use
3. Willing and able to contribute to the learning of others

## [⏫ Basic Admission Test](#)

When considering SkilStak™ part of the process is for the potential
student to attend *Prep* and possibly also *Fundamentals* for free
to audit it. During a portion of the class time the potential student
is given an assessment test to be completed strictly within 15
minutes.

While the exact content of every exam will differ slightly for every
student the format and general areas will be the same. They are as
follows:

* Login to Gmail
* Send email to your SkilStak™ location’s email address asking for
  the test
* Receive the response email containing the test questions
* Complete the answers to the test questions in the email
* Send the completed test as an email response back

This all happens during the 15 minutes that the student is on site
at SkilStak™. 

> ⛔ Parents will not be allowed to help with any part of the
exam including logging the potential student into Gmail.

### [⏫ Reading Comprehension](#)

The test questions will include reading comprehension by going to
a web site and reading the material and responding by typed responses.

### [⏫ Basic Math](#)

The test will also include several basic math questions involving
addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, fractions, decimals
and simple graphing coordinates.

### [⏫ Strictly Timed](#)

One main purpose of this exam is to ensure students can perform the
basics that other students are expected to know in about the same
time frame as them. This means those candidates with slow typing
speeds (< 10 wpm), undeveloped motor skills, or reading comprehension
impairments will likely not complete within the allotted time.

### [⏫ Unlimited Attempts, Fee Required](#)

The first audit and admission exam is free. However, candidates can
take the exam as many times as they like for a $50 fee for each
attempt.

## [⏫ No Age Limit](#)

While our custom course material is designed for those generally from
eight to eighteen *anyone* of *any* age can seek admission.
